it's so difficult to write the code for camelcase . I get what must be done but how do i do it though yohhh. The understanding is easy but  coding is difficult.THE github is also giving me a hard time.All the project were not easy but i managed to get though it an wrote the code an i think  i will be able to write the other codes as well. The theory part and the lectures a so much easier to understand than the actual work.The work part of the project is a lot more difficult than i thought.I dont get how it will get easier but as i go the more i get to understand , especially when i i code and the code does what it's supposed to do that makes me extremely happy.# Projects_wtc
